// The wallets we offer: active NEAR wallets people use (Meteor, HOT, Here, Nightly, Intear, NEAR
// Mobile; Coin98 removed 14 Nov) plus WalletConnect for Trust and others. OKX is out for now: it refuses to connect
// below 0.1 NEAR and its burner accounts are not on chain. Order is only the default; the
// picker puts wallets that can sign you in first, using the selector's own capability check
// (see probe.ts).
//
// Trust Wallet connects through WalletConnect, which needs a project id from
// https://cloud.reown.com in NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID. Without one WalletConnect is
// not offered; the other wallets still work.
